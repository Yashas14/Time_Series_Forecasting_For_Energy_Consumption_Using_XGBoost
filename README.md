# 🌟 Time Series Forecasting for Energy Consumption Using XGBoost

## 🎯 Business Objective

In this project, we tackle the challenge of accurately forecasting energy consumption using the powerful XGBoost algorithm. By analyzing historical data, we aim to provide insights that can help optimize energy usage and improve resource allocation.

### Goals:

- Predict future energy consumption trends.
- Enhance decision-making processes for energy management.
- Provide actionable insights for policymakers and stakeholders.

## 📊 Data Description

We use the **PJME Hourly Energy Consumption** dataset, which includes hourly energy consumption data. This dataset is crucial for developing a model that can forecast energy consumption patterns with high accuracy.

### Dataset Breakdown:

- **Training Data**: 70% of the total data
- **Validation Data**: 15% of the total data
- **Test Data**: 15% of the total data

The data includes the following features:

- **Datetime**: The timestamp of the energy consumption reading.
- **Energy Consumption**: The amount of energy consumed (in MW).

## 🛠 Methodology

### 1. Data Collection
   - Historical energy consumption data is gathered from reliable sources.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
   - Handling missing values.
   - Removing outliers.
   - Normalizing and scaling the data.

### 3. Feature Engineering
   - Creating time-based features (hour, day, month).
   - Identifying seasonal trends.
   - Incorporating external factors (e.g., weather conditions).

### 4. Model Implementation
   - Using the XGBoost algorithm to train the predictive model.
   - Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.

### 5. Model Evaluation
   - Assessing the model using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and accuracy.
   - Comparing results with baseline models.

### 6. Results Analysis
   - Interpreting the model's predictions.
   - Visualizing the forecasted trends.

## 🚀 Results

The XGBoost model demonstrated impressive accuracy in forecasting energy consumption, with the following performance metrics:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: 3538.94
- **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: 4325.35
- **Accuracy**: 89.05%

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- **Incorporate Additional Variables**: Including more external factors such as weather data, economic indicators, and policy changes.
- **Hybrid Models**: Combining XGBoost with other machine learning and deep learning techniques for improved accuracy.
- **Enhanced Interpretability**: Developing methods to make the model's predictions more interpretable for stakeholders.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Further fine-tuning of hyperparameters and expanding the dataset for better model performance.
